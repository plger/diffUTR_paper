	abstract = {PolyA\_DB is a database cataloging cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs) in several genomes. Previous versions were based mainly on expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which had a limited amount and could lead to inaccurate PAS identification due to the presence of internal A-rich sequences in transcripts. Here, we present an updated version of the database based solely on deep sequencing data. First, PASs are mapped by the 3′ region extraction and deep sequencing (3′READS) method, ensuring unequivocal PAS identification. Second, a large volume of data based on diverse biological samples increases PAS coverage by 3.5-fold over the EST-based version and provides PAS usage information. Third, strand-specific RNA-seq data are used to extend annotated 3′ ends of genes to obtain more thorough annotations of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites. Fourth, conservation information of PAS across mammals sheds light on significance of APA sites. The database (URL: http://www.polya-db.org/v3) currently holds PASs in human, mouse, rat and chicken, and has links to the UCSC genome browser for further visualization and for integration with other genomic data.},

	abstract = {The length of untranslated regions at the 3’ end of transcripts (3’UTRs) is regulated by alternate polyadenylation (APA). 3’UTRs contain regions that harbor binding motifs for regulatory molecules. However, the mechanisms that coordinate the 3’UTR length of specific groups of transcripts are not well understood. We therefore developed a method, CSI-UTR, that models 3’UTR structure as tandem segments between functional alternative-polyadenylation sites (termed cleavage site intervals – CSIs). This approach facilitated 1) profiling of 3’UTR isoform expression changes and 2) statistical enrichment of putative regulatory motifs. CSI-UTR analysis is UTR-annotation independent and can interrogate legacy data generated from standard RNA-Seq libraries. CSI-UTR identified a set of CSIs in human and rodent transcriptomes. Analysis of RNA-Seq datasets from neural tissue identified differential expression events within 3’UTRs not detected by standard gene-based differential expression analyses. Further, in many instances 3’UTR and CDS from the same gene were regulated differently. This modulation of motifs for RNA-interacting molecules with potential condition-dependent and tissue-specific RNA binding partners near the polyA signal and CSI junction may play a mechanistic role in the specificity of alternative polyadenylation. Source code, CSI BED files and example datasets are available at: https://github.com/UofLBioinformatics/CSI-UTR},
