# Simulation

* See [polyestersimulation.R](polyestersimulation.R) for the code used to generate the simulated reads. 
* [diffgenes.rds](diffgenes.rds) contains the genes with gene-level differential-expression (not utr/isoform change).
* [difftranscripts.rds](difftranscripts.rds) contains the genes with UTR changes.
* The simulation parameters as well as simulated reads can be downloaded from [figshare](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13726143).
